# GettingStartedWithOpenCV
The majroity of the projects in this folder deal with image/object detection.

There are two different ways to do perform object detection. One is the traditional method, which I used for both facial recognition and stop sign detection. The second is the deep learning method which is much more accurate and faster than the traditional ML tools. 

1) Traditional ML tools - computer vision
In traditional ML image/object detection, the first step involves preprocessing the image and feature extraction. Feature extraction involves seperating the essential information from the non-essential information and throwing away the non-essential information. There are many feature extraction algorithms that exist, but the one that was used by me in these practice was SIFT(Scale-Invariant Feature Transform). After feature extraction, we must then use a learning algorithm for classification. The algorithm that was used was SVM, which is a fairly accurate algorithm. The learning algorithm must be trained with a dataset before it can be used to classify an image/object.
